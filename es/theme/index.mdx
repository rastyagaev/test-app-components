        “I thanked him for letting me play, and he thanked me for coming so far,”
        the American filmmaker Jon Alpert said of Vladimir Putin.
        “So he must have figured out who I was.”

      In May, playing hockey in an annual charity exhibition alongside a half-dozen former N.H.L.
      stars, in Sochi, Vladimir Putin scored five goals and assisted on four more.
      In previous years, despite learning to skate only in his late fifties, he’d scored
      as many as eight. “Western journalists ask me how it’s possible,” Slava Fetisov, one of
      Putin’s teammates and a two-time Stanley Cup winner with the Detroit Red Wings, told me recently.
      “Let’s say Pavel Bure or Sergei Fedorov”—Hall of Famers both—“score two goals, and the President
      scores five or six or seven. I say, ‘You have to be in the right time, in the right place.’
      That’s what our President does. He’s got a good shot. He understands the game. This is unteachable.
      If it’s in your genes—your blood—you can play.” Fetisov, who serves as a senator in the Russian Duma,
      referred to Putin as “one of the most popular leaders in the world,” and added, “this is one
      of the most unique examples in the history of big politicians, to show they can play the hardest
      possible sport.” He meant this, he explained, in the sense of providing a healthy model for children,
      who might otherwise succumb to “street challenges,” like alcohol and drugs. He cited other examples
      of Putin’s “God-gifted” athleticism: “He can ride the horse, he can swim, he can skate, he can ski,
      he can do judo and sambo and karate.”

      One can be plenty familiar with Putin-related propaganda—the pectoral flaunting on horseback,
      the black-belt demonstrations—and still be surprised to hear it reinforced so explicitly in
      conversation. Fetisov is revered by sports fans on two continents, not only for his grace on the
      ice but for his courage in standing up to the Soviet regime that sought to prevent him from playing
      in the United States—which, he told me, is the only country other than Russia where he can imagine
      wanting to live. “The people are so warm, so friendly, so patriotic,” he said of Americans.
      The fact that relations between the two countries have devolved almost to Cold War levels is
      a source of distress for Fetisov, he said, and so, two months ago, in the interest of diplomacy,
      he smuggled an American filmmaker onto the ice in Sochi as a player on Putin’s opposing team.
